# IoT Project

## Product background and objectives

Concept: System for detecting emergency situations for a user in a wheelchair (elderly, disabled, etc.). 

Two devices: One on a wheelchair (embedded seat pad), other one wearable (on wrist?)

Wheelchair unit detects person sitting and barometric pressure, connects to wearable device via BLE and to the Internet via WiFi.

Wearable device detects heart rate and barometric pressure which then calculates the change of height. Connects to chair unit via Wi-Fi.

## Webpage design and programming


website and a phone page/app interface as one to access the data, which also automatically sends text messages to direct family members. 

what the interface will show
heart rate in the past few days, 2 types of diagram display (for the medical professionals)
diagram of different data
seat movement - the sleeping hours (leave the seat over 1 hours) 

web page
have user name and password setting
nurses/doctor can access the data from their devices

column
heart diagram




need for the website
graphs for the heart rate for a week
time off the seat, sleep duration graph
altimeter data, plot, flot charts

other programming on the website
Login - username and password connected to the device
Send direct text to close relative when emergency occur

## Embedded design and programming
- Components, their interfacing and communication

## Project execution
- what we wanted the device to be like, how we wanted it to function

## Final product
- Did the final product meet our expectations
- where did we succeed / fail?
- what would the future of the device look like, improvements etc.
